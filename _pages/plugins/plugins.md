Plugins add additional functionality to Windower. While addons are written in Lua, Windower plugins are compiled from source code, usually C++, and delivered as DLL files.

Plugins are developed and maintained by the Windower team. They are automatically kept up to date by the launcher, and can be set to load automatically when you log in.

**Note:** [Addons](../addons/) are now the preferred method of extending Windower functionality.
