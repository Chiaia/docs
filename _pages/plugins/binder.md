title: Binder
---

Binder is a replacement for the classic G15Binder plugin, with new features, and support for a much wider array of devices.

## Features

When a key is pressed on one of the supported devices below an alias of the form `<device>_<key>` (e.g. `g510_m3g10`) is executed; when the key is released, an alias with the same name but with `_up` appended to the end (e.g. `g510_m3g10_up`) is executed.

**Note:** *Unless stated otherwise, you must use a default or blank profile for Final Fantasy XI in the software for your device.*
